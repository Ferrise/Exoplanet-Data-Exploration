# Exoplanet Data Visualizations
Much can be learned about astronomical objects through data visualizations. Using datasets containing various information about exoplanets from **Nasa Exoplanet Archive** and **The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia**, I will illustrate various properties of exoplanets. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
Exoplanet.Archive <- read.csv(file="composite_planet_data.csv")
Exoplanet.Catalog <- read.csv(file="exoplanet.eu_catalog.csv")
```
